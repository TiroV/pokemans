Hello and welome. The simple function of the app I've made is to display a list of 150+ pokemon that scales up or down depending on need. 
It displays the picture, the height, the weight, the typing, and a sprite of the pokemon. There are clickable buttons to display the modal and a functioning search bar.

The code itself is broken down mostly into where the functions are and what each one does, with comments. I've done my best with indentation and making proper comments to denote what does what. I hope it's helpful!
